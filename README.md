# Dash - A Dashboard of your things and stuff

> A customizable personal dashboard with a focus on speed, simplicity and security üöÄ

## Intro üßÅ

This is a fairly simple app, which (at the moment), it's literally just a glorified list of links (with a slightly questionable color scheme, lol)

![bad-quality-screen-recording](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/alicia-app/master/demo.gif "I made a gif screenshot for you")

**Demo**: https://dash-demo.as93.net ‚ú®

üëÜ *Here is an example (I've changed the source of the links, stripped personal data, and removed auth so you can see something running)*

### Aim üéØ

The aim, is for users *(or maybe just me)*, to spend the minimum possible time on on this screen *(aka opposite of what Mark Zuckerberg strives for)*. This is achieved through intuitive keyboard shortcuts, for just about everything, enabling you to navigate to the link you need, asap:

- ‚ö° Just start typing, and the search-field will auto-focus and items are filtered instantly
- ‚ö° Press tab, tab tab to navigate through filtered results, then hit enter to launch it
- ‚ö° Use Esc at anytime to clear the filter field and show everything
- ‚ö° Collapse/ hide sections that you use less often, and it'll be remembered in session storage

### Err, why? ü§®

I made this because whenever I open a new tab, there's usually only 1 of a few sites I want to visit, and it annoys me that they either have to be buried deep into the bookmarks, or displayed in an illogical order on my new-tab page. The problem is made worse, as I usually use privacy browsers which don't store any of my settings or history. Also I hate using the mouse, it's not cool.

So it's true that I did make it just for my own use. And I've not spent a lot of time on it. - But still all the code is nice and neat, tested and documented- and I'm publishing it here, in case it (or any components of it), could be any use to anybody else :innocent::octocat:

## Road map üõ£Ô∏è

I have a vague idea of what I want to build, what I will use it for, and how I can make it easy and reusable for anyone else who'd like to use it.

### V1 - List of Links | (Done) ‚úÖ

- There should be a Vue app, that reads data from a JSON source and displays a categorized list of links
- Tiles (aka links) should display text, have a URL location, and optionally show a nice icon
- Tiles should have an optional tooltip to show essential info. And where titles are long, they should be shown in full, on hover
- Categories/ sections should be collapsable, and this should be persisted in session storage
- It should be possible, seamless and intuitive to filter, navigate and launch tiles with just the keyboard
- The code must be nice, (lint, test, comment/ document and generally follow some kind if standard)

### V2 - Additional features | üîú

- Data should be stored in an external, encrypted cloud service and security needs to be top priority
- UI improvements, and theme switching (light, dark, gradient and material)
- Widgets, with persistent memory:Notes, todo, link paster, weather, agender, news and notifications etc

### V3 - Functionality to do everything through the UI | üí§

- Ability to add, edit, reorder and delete both tiles and sections, from the UI
- Tile data for users encrypted and stored, read/ write on server, then decrypted on client-side
- Harden security further, try and hack it, then make it even safer
- Host a public version, with a user management system. Allowing users to register/ login then create and manage their own version.

## Developing üß±

The project is structured in a fairly standard way, so to get started just git clone, cd into it, yarn install the dependencies (or npm, if your that way inclined- no judging here). Then use the following scripts to do what you need to:

- `yarn run dev` - Starts dev server, with hot-reload, and diff-linting
- `yarn run build` - Compiles and minifies for production
- `yarn run start` - Will serve up the **built**  production app from the `dist` dir
- `yarn run lint` - Lints and fixes files
- `yarn run test` - Runs all tests

You can then add the data for links in JSON (following the format in the example file [item-data.json](https://github.com/Lissy93/alicia-app/blob/master/src/data/item-data.json)), and host it wherever works for you. Don't forget to secure requests to resources, and password-protect the running app if you host it online üîí

Side note: ok, I know the styling is kind of ugly, but go easy on me, I was drunk when I coded this thing ü•¥ And I haven't over-used gradients like this since 2015, when they were last cool :trollface:
